# Driverless-Model-Car-Project
A-level computer science project using computer vision to control a model car

my final A level computer science project in which i made a driverless model car, using computer vision. I attached a wireless FPV camera to a remote controlled car and used a BBC microbit controller to operate the car using a remote pc. The program receives and processes the output of the camera using OpenCV. Using this we can track specific colour values selected using the programs GUI. This allows the user to isolate specific objects in the real world around the car. The program then is able to recognise where in the camera's field of vision the object is and, using a heuristic approach, drive the car to the object.
